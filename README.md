# Career Guidance

Students and parents often face difficulties when it comes to gathering detailed information about colleges, including tuition fees, eligibility criteria, scholarships, placements, and more. This application helps students find the most suitable college and course based on their academic records, interests, aptitude, and psychometric assessments. It supports decision-making for both Indian and international institutions. Using Admin Panel admin can create, edit and delete college information and assessment test questions. Students can attempt test and get college recommendations and interests using user panel.

    DATABASES = { 
      'default': { 
          'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql', 
          'NAME': 'career_guidance', # Ensure this DB exists in your  MySQL server

              'charset': 'utf8mb4', 
          }, 
   
      } 
  }
  ```

  Note: Make sure you've already created a database named career_guidance in MySQL before running migrations. 

  e) Run migrations 
  ```
  python manage.py makemigrations 
  python manage.py migrate
  ```
  f) Run the Django server 
    ```
      python manage.py runserver
    ```

  ## Frontend (React) Setup
  
  a) Open a new terminal and go to the frontend directory:
    ```
    cd frontend 
    ```
  b) Install frontend dependencies
    ```
    npm install 
    ```
  c) Start the React app 

  ```
  npm start
  ```

  d) Setup Instructions 

  Since this project uses a local MySQL Server, the database is not hosted online. Therefore, simply cloning the repository will not provide access to the required data. You must manually import the initial data for the application to function correctly. Ensure all required fields are populated; these are critical for: 
    - Assessments to run correctly 
    - College recommendations to work 
    - User profile interest/personality mapping 

  There are two options: 
  ### Option 1: Insert Data Manually (via Admin Panel)
  
  - Run the Django server using python manage.py runserver. 
  - Open the admin panel from home page 
  - Register and Login 
  - Insert required data in the same order as shown in the side panel

  ### Option 2: Import Provided SQL Dump (Recommended) 
  - In the root folder of the cloned project, you'll find a folder named CareerGuidanceData, which contains all the SQL dump files.
  - Open MySQL Workbench.
  - Navigate to: Server â†’ Data Import.
  - Choose "Import from Dump Project Folder".
  - Browse and select the CareerGuidanceData folder location.
  - Click on "Load Folder Contents".
  - Select the schema career_guidance.
  - Under Import Progress, click Start Import.
After import, verify the tables and data to ensure the setup is successful.
